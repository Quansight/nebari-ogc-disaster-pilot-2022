# OGC Disaster Pilot 2022: Cloud processing of spatial data using Nebari

Cloud processing of spatial data has incredible promise for rapid, scalable insights and geographic awareness, particularly in emergency and disaster situations. The only problem: it's still very difficult to deploy, tricky to limit cost, and complicated to interchange different cloud platforms. 

The Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) and Quansight, building upon the Disaster Pilot initiatives is running a virtual workshop on July 7-8, 2022 to show how Nebari can be used to automate the cloud deployment and maintainance of a spatial data science platform on the cloud of your choice.
